MapNotes2 is an application that aids you in remembering your favorite sporting events.  Click the "+" button to add a memory to your growing list of them.  Click on each cell to reminisce about epic games and time spent with friends.  Data will save when relaunching app.

Cool features I worked on for this release include 1) Nicer UI--finding a really visually satifying background, deciding what fonts best match the background etc, 2) turning off locationManager as you exit the app (borrowed from homework 2a) to save battery, 3) an Icon.

So what are you waiting for?? Start logging some lasting memories! ...That will be deleted as soon as you exit the app because we haven't learned CoreData yet... :)
